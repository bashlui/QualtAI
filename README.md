i-HackTec x uOttaHack Hackathon project. 

To get started, clone the repository to your current machine
```bash
git clone [repository link]
```
and when you open it on your editor, make sure you have Live Server to see the website. I leave a link here to install [Live Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer)
You right click the HTML file and run it, and that's it!
